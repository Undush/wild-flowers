	<br><p> The easiest way to grow seedlings and do not forget is to sow the seeds directly in the open ground in July <br> and hide them under cover material for two weeks before they appear. This unpretentious flower prefers <br> light, loose soil - moist, but with good drainage, so the garden should be slightly shaded. Remember, it <br> blooms better in the shade than in the sun, and this process lasts up to 2 months. In addition, in the summer <br> the plants should be fed systematically and regularly, but not watered too much.</p>
	<p><i>Important! Don't forget me The bush can be divided without fear - the root system of this flower is perfectly suited for transplanting.</i> </p>
